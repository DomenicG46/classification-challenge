# classification-challenge
I am subitting this really really late. 
I have no excuse I just out it off. 
It is an easier project and I thought it was too
easy so I took it for granted and just put on back burner. 
I was able to figure out the models and run through a couple more during our
Project2 assignment as well
I understand the prediction models well and am looking forward to using
them more in the future.
